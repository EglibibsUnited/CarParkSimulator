* no actor (stickmun) on all
* add simulation interface before first object & after stickmun
* align methods
* no arrows need to come back

* objects only communicate with objects that the class diagram allows

* SENSOR
* no boundary class

* look at code behind for user interface in skeleton program to see what assigncarpark does
~ don't use assigncarpark in sequence diagram ~
~ Use the .exe to determine what functions need to do what (what order and what actually happens to the car park things)
